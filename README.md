# Intent Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying user intents from text inputs using various NLP techniques and machine learning models. The project is implemented in Google Colab and covers traditional machine learning approaches, deep learning models, and transformer-based solutions.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into 3 main tasks:
1. **Traditional ML Approaches**: Using Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and FastText with classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
2. **Deep Learning Models**: Implementing CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and hybrid architectures
3. **Transformer Models**: Fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa for intent classification

## Dataset
- File: `NLP Dataset.csv`
- Contains text inputs (`INPUT`) and corresponding intent labels (`INTENT`)
- Preprocessing includes text cleaning, stopword removal, and feature engineering
